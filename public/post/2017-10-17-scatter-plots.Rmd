```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```

This is an example of the code we use to make scatterplots:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID, sum(HR) AS career_HR,
sum(SO) AS career_SO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result, aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=4, color="green")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts vs. Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
